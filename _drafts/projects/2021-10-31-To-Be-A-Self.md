## Overview
these are field notes
from the gentle explorations 
of a wandering mind
into the contradictions of being
these are observations
of growth amidst confusion
these are cries of belonging
to an entity ever-changing
identities in questioning
seeking out and looking in
to find the worlds within
and step back into this skin
 
- what is it to be a self?

Cover design was created by pixel-sorting an image with Python, then post-processing the color in PhotoShop.

**Abstract**  
In this study, a near real-time biofeedback system was developed, using inertial motion capture and augmented reality (AR) glasses. The system is designed to give feedback on foot progression angle (FPA), commonly used in gait interventions for knee osteoarthritis patients. Through alterations of this angle, mechanical loading on the knee joint can be reduced. By doing so, disease progression is slowed down and patients are able to lead daily lives with reduced physical pain. With the use of mixed reality technology glasses and inertial motion captures of the body, the system is able to provide patients with interventions in an ambulatory setting, in contrast to that of the current clinical research practices which use treadmills and cameras. Through two rounds of experimental testing of the prototype (with four healthy participants altogether), the usability and effectiveness of this system are evaluated by using gait analysis and the System Usability Scale (SUS). Experimental results of the system prototype show that the system is usable, although there is still much to be improved regarding system performance and accuracy. Further research and development should be done before it can actually be deployed for use with knee osteoarthritis patients. Nevertheless, the proposed system could enable wider adoption of gait retraining rehabilitation applications by reducing complexity and cost.
