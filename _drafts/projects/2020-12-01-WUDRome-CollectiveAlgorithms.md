## Overview
This study examines the creative potentials of algorithms and how AI tools may be utilized by media artists to reappropriate them from tools of discrimination to tools of liberation. Through a case study and a critical making assignment, key findings regarding AI affordances are identified and related to appropriation in creative practice through the lens of play theory. AI affordances offer a range of possibilities for creative practices, which, when creatively appropriated, redefine the values and purposes of algorithms. The reflective capabilities of algorithms allow for deeper reflections on societal issues, making media art a powerful platform for addressing algorithmic bias and sparking critical discussions. Insights derived from critical inspection of tools and creative practices are used to develop the notion of the algorithmic reimagination. Algorithmic reimagination is a notion that embodies skills and attitudes that seek to challenge the dominant logics of algorithms and open pathways for actions. By embracing the spirit of play and imagination, artists can engage with algorithmic tools to provoke discussion, while envisioning a more just and equitable future. This paper highlights the significance of the algorithmic reimagination in shaping the narrative and impact of algorithms in contemporary society and in paving the way for a more inclusive and ethical AI culture from the domain of media art.

**Abstract**  
In this study, a near real-time biofeedback system was developed, using inertial motion capture and augmented reality (AR) glasses. The system is designed to give feedback on foot progression angle (FPA), commonly used in gait interventions for knee osteoarthritis patients. Through alterations of this angle, mechanical loading on the knee joint can be reduced. By doing so, disease progression is slowed down and patients are able to lead daily lives with reduced physical pain. With the use of mixed reality technology glasses and inertial motion captures of the body, the system is able to provide patients with interventions in an ambulatory setting, in contrast to that of the current clinical research practices which use treadmills and cameras. Through two rounds of experimental testing of the prototype (with four healthy participants altogether), the usability and effectiveness of this system are evaluated by using gait analysis and the System Usability Scale (SUS). Experimental results of the system prototype show that the system is usable, although there is still much to be improved regarding system performance and accuracy. Further research and development should be done before it can actually be deployed for use with knee osteoarthritis patients. Nevertheless, the proposed system could enable wider adoption of gait retraining rehabilitation applications by reducing complexity and cost.
