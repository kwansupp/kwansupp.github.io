Some questions that I find interesting and have been pondering on lately. If you'd like to discuss them with me or have suggestions for further reading, feel free to get in touch!

+ **How can cause and effect reasoning (causality) affect bias?**  
  How would it work if applied to intelligent systems? How would it affect the robustness of deployed ML systems?


+ **We get attached to things. In an age where entertainment/communication technologies run our lives, what does this mean for the man-machine marriage/symbiosis?**  
  What will the world be like if every home has a personal assistant robot? Will the impact be as large, if not larger, than that of having a PC in every household?


+ **Why are government structures designed the way they are now?**  
  Are there better ways to design them? How did they come up with the number of people in a cabinet, etc.? Is it possible to design systems that prevent corruption â€” a system that filters and prevents ill-meaning politicians from getting to the top?
