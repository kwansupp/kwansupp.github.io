Hi! I'm Kwan. I'm currently working as a software engineer in the Netherlands.

I have a broad background, having done a Bachelor of Science in Technology and Liberal Arts & Sciences at the University of Twente (University College). During my bachelor studies, I did my focus towards Biomedical Engineering and did a minor in BioRobotics. I also spent some time exploring graphics design and followed a sketching course for industrial design students. I've applied some of my design skills to create a cookbook!

# My Philosophy

Curiosity, Creativity, Community.

**Finding the dots and connecting them.**

> “To stay eager, to connect, to find interest in the everyday, to notice what everybody else overlooks — these are vital skills and noble goals. They speak between looking and seeing, between hearing and listening, between accepting what the world presents and noticing what matters to you.”  
> <p align="right">- Rob Walker, The Art of Noticing</p>

The pursuit of truth is what keeps me curious. I strive to understand the world and the workings of our society. Truth comes in multiple forms - empirical, historical, emotional, theoretical. Truths combine to form new truths. Every being to each their own. Studying various disciplines, observing nature, appreciating art, talking to strangers — curiosity allows me to explore and find the dots which are the points of truth. 

With every knowledge and observation, I seek to find the connection. To draw the lines between the dots. To update my state of truth with every iteration of findings.

**Making the most with what we have.**

I believe that it is in our nature to create. It is an expression of self and individuality. Creativity drives us to make the most with what we have. Not what we will have or what we had, but what we have in this moment.

**Inspiring and lifting people up.**

Everytime I reflect on my life, I consider myself lucky. Lucky to have good health. I want to use my knowledge and skills to help people live better lives - to be kind (to themselves and others), to live authentically and to unlock their full potential (in achieving their dreams and contribute to the world).


# Other things about me

In my free time I enjoy various sports and am a competitive soccer player. I play the alto saxophone and am learning the guitar. 

I also enjoy reading various sorts of books. Lately, I've been reading a lot of philosophy and memoir, but I like to switch things up every now and then. I love classical literature and novels. I believe reading opens worlds and I try to read various sorts of books to be able to understand the different worlds, which I hope gives me a better understanding of people.
