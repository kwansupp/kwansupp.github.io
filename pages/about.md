Hi! I'm Kwan. I'm currently working as a software engineer in the Netherlands.

I have a broad background, having done a Bachelor of Science in Technology and Liberal Arts & Sciences at the University of Twente (University College). During my bachelor studies, I did my focus towards Biomedical Engineering and did a minor in BioRobotics. I also spent some time exploring graphics design and followed a sketching course for industrial design students. I've applied some of my design skills in creating a cookbook!

In my free time I enjoy various sports and am a competitive soccer player. I play the alto saxophone and am learning the guitar. 

I also enjoy reading various sorts of books. Lately, I've been reading a lot of philosophy and memoir, but I like to switch things up every now and then. I love classical literature and novels. I believe reading opens worlds and I try to read various sorts of books to be able to understand the different worlds, which I hope gives me a better understanding of people.

I live my life on a search for truth.
