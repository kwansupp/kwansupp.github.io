This assigment was one of my first 'dabble' in neural networks. Working together with a partner, we built a neural network in Matlab and applied it to the MNIST dataset to classify digits. Working through this assignment as a pair allowed us to discuss concepts in machine learning with each other, sharpening our understanding of the topic while waiting for the network to train.
