This project is an artistic exploration of the relationship between food, culture, and community, as well as a way of giving back to the ATLAS community. As an honors bachelor studies program, ATLAS students are required to live in ATLAS housing at least in the first year of university. Being inspired by the diversity of the community and my friends' cooking skills (or lack thereof), along with wanting to develop my graphics design skills, I set out to publish a student cookbook.
