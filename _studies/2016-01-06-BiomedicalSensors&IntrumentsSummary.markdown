A project that explores a hypothetical future in which humans colonize Mars. 
The overarching goal of this project is to sharpen interdisciplinary research skills.

Within this project, we have created a project proposal for monitoring health in extraterresterial settings. Within the proposal is also a basic theoretical framework for an ideal health technology for such an extreme environment.

As an extra study alongside this project, we read and summarized the book "Biomedical Sensors & Instruments".

We also summarized the different research methodology we have learned in this semester and their implications within our project scenario.
