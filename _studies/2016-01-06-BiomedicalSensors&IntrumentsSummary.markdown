A project that explores a hypothetical future in which humans colonize Mars. 
The overarching goal of this project is to sharpen interdisciplinary research skills.

Within this project, we have created a project proposal for monitoring health in extraterresterial settings. Within the proposal is also a basic theoretical framework for an ideal health technology for such an extreme environment.

We worked in a group of 4, with two different subtopics: stress in space and implementing wearable health technology in extraterresterial settings. I was in the pair that worked on the second subtopic.

As an extra study alongside this project, we read and summarized the book "Biomedical Sensors & Instruments". <a href='/assets/docs/Biomedical_Sensors_and_Instruments_Summary.pdf' target="_blank">[Summary of Biomedical Sensors & Instruments]</a>

We also summarized the different research methodology we have learned in this semester and their implications within our project scenario. <a href='/assets/docs/IRM-final-assignment.pdf' target="_blank">[Methodological Review]</a>
