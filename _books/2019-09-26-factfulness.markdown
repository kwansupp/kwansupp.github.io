I had bought this book off the shelf of a bookstore at my local train station. At the time, I was contemplating questions of how we could end ignorance. Some say education, but even with education, people can still CHOOSE to ignore. I was hoping to get some insights into how the author addresses this problem.

Even after having bought the book, it took me around a week before finally picking it up. Incidentally, during that week, I was surfing the web - trying to find an answer to how to end ignorance - when I stumbled upon a TED Talk with the topic of "How not to be ignorant" by Hans and Ola Rosling. I thought the name sounded familiar, so decided to google it. That's when I realized they were also the author of the book I had just bought!

Having read Michelle Obama's book "Becoming", the message that stuck with me was that real change takes time. In Factfulness, it's cool to see the changes that so many people have worked for and towards being put into quantified facts.
