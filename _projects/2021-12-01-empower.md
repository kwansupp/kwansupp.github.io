## Overview

A digital platform to enable local municipalities to start and accelerate energy transition initiatives. 

EMPOWER 2.0 is a 3 years transnational project that is experimenting on how to empower citizens during their journeys to become energy prosumers. For that, a total of 7 pilots are conducted in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Denmark. Through the learning from these pilots different sub-products have been designed. One of them is a toolkit: a digital platform that is an inventory of tools to help prosumers with their green energy projects. This platform is an energy transition toolkit that is an inventory of digital tools and contents from external sources in order to guide users through their energy transition projects.

Together with the Urban Technology research group at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam (HvA), weâ€™ve implemented the final prototype of the platform, which will be deployed for use by municipalities and their citizens.
