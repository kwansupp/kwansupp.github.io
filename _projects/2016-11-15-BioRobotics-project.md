## Overview

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder which causes muscle degeneration. Symptoms often begin to develop in early childhood
Motivation

<br/>
Robot in action, controlled through bicep activations. 1 & 2 - Picking up burger "patty" with spatula. 3 - Elevated edges (white) on spatula, aids in flipping the patty.

### Role
This project was completed in a group of 4 people over the course of a quartile (September - November 2016). My roles within the project varied throughout the different phases. 

In the beginning I was involved in the systems design, helping the group to come up with the requirements and specifications. After having generated our concepts, I was in charge of the concept visualizations, clearly communicating our ideas through sketches.

In the design phase, I designed some of the components for our final design in SolidWorks. I was also involved in the mathematical calculations for modelling the dynamics (to assess the behavior of the robot).

Embodiment

After having built and evaluated the robot, I was responsible for presenting our product demo.
