## Overview
In this workshop, we introduced participants to low-code AI text and image synthesis tools and provided them with frameworks for going into conversation with AI. With the generated poems as inspiration, participants created animations. After the workshop, we selected portions from each group, and shaped it into a storyline to fit the theme for the Society 5.0 Festival, modifiying and infusing it with our own writing as well. The curation and edits are put together into a final audiovisual piece. This project was an exploration of new modes of human-machine content creation.
