## Overview
Googless is a multidisciplinary project focusing on the issue of big tech monopolies and specifically on Google as one of the most prominent examples. By revealing the omnipresence of tracking tools, Googless hopes to influence how we approach our digital rights and inspire those in charge of protecting them to take a stand against data hoarding and unfair market practices.
