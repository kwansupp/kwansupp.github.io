## Role
This project was completed in a group of 5 over the course of a quartile (November 2016 - January 2017).
Within this project, I was actively involved throughout. The process included: 
 - Problem definition
 - Research of microfluidics theory and methodology
 - Chip designs
 - Lab experiments to test chip designs  
 - Analysis of chip performance
 - Report write-up

In our research phase, we looked into multiple techniques that could possibly filter and detect endoparasite eggs. We divided the research of amongst the five of us. My research focus was on electrical detection (detecting parasite eggs with the use of electrodes), which we deemed as an unsuitable option for our solution. This was because there is a risk that the heat generated from the electrodes will accelerate the hatching of the parasite eggs, which will clog and ruin the chip.

During the design phase, we had to create 2D designs which laid the basis for the 3D designs that were used for fabrication. I was more involved in the 3D designs, which was done in SolidWorks.
