## Overview
these are field notes
from the gentle explorations 
of a wandering mind
into the contradictions of being
these are observations
of growth amidst confusion
these are cries of belonging
to an entity ever-changing
identities in questioning
seeking out and looking in
to find the worlds within
and step back into this skin
 
- what is it to be a self?

Cover design was created by pixel-sorting an image with Python, then post-processing the color in PhotoShop.
