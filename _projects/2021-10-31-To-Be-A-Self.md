## Overview
these are field notes
<br/>
from the gentle explorations 
<br/>
of a wandering mind
<br/>
into the contradictions of being
<br/>
these are observations
<br/>
of growth amidst confusion
<br/>
these are cries of belonging
<br/>
to an entity ever-changing
<br/>
identities in questioning
<br/>
seeking out and looking in
<br/>
to find the worlds within
<br/>
and step back into this skin
<br/>
<br/> 
-- what is it to be a self?

<br/>

This is a collection of 20 poetry and prose pieces written in August 2023, exploring themes of belonging, brokenness, redemption, (self-)love, and capturing beauty in the little moments of life.

The cover design was created by pixel-sorting an image with Python, then post-processed for coloring in PhotoShop.
