## Overview

This project was completed as part of the course Empirical Evidence in Engineering. The goal is to design a data-acquisition system and to use it to derive meaningful insights. 

In a group of 4 people, we designed a system to monitor plant growth, more specifically watercress. The system incorporates the use of light sensor, moisture sensure, and a (Raspberry pi) camera.

## Role
Apart from being actively involved in the setups of the various sensors, my focus was on analyzing the light acquisition and tackling the challenges in image acquisition. As we wamted to use images to
