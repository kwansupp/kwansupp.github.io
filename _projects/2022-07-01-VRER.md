## Overview
With educational escape rooms (EER), students can learn by doing as we are able to offer real challenges in virtual settings through computer engagement. <a href="https://view.genial.ly/605af40109c4b00d15863dd4" target="_blank">[Stella Dolce EER]</a> – currently implemented at the Professorship of Entrepreneurship – aims to teach students about entrepreneurship in a fun, gamified environment.

Together with students and the lecturers, we co-designed VR EER using Mozilla Hubs based on Stella Dolce EER to work towards a fully-fledged VR experience in education. In this version, students with a VR headset will be able to interact with the educational material not from a screen, but rather in an immersive virtual environment. The final version will be used by the students in entrepreneurship at the HvA. This helps students learn about entrepreneurship in a more active learning environment.

With entrepreneurship learning heavily depending on experience, gamification in EER plays a crucial role in creating an active learning environment. It helps make learning more engaging and memorable. Additionally, the simulated setting provides safe space for practice. The aim is to encourage students to feel comfortable with making mistakes – and learn from them. In the co-creation process of the VR EER, students are learning to use design thinking and storytelling by giving them credibility for the making of the educational material.
