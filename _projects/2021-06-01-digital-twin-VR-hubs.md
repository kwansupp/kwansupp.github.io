## Overview

This concept explores the potential of the hybrid campus. The hybrid campus unites and goes beyond both digital and physical campuses to facilitate a sense of place, shared embodied experiences, and serendipitous encounters toward developing a sense of belonging. The digital twin of a campus is just part of the potential offered by digital spaces. The potential of extending “the real space,” e.g. to have infinite meeting spaces or to be able to teleport to alternative locations are all opportunities offered by digital spaces. But, how can participation be equalised whether connecting in person, in virtual reality or via a laptop? For example, to organise future graduation ceremonies so that they can carry a similar weight as in-person ceremonies of the past. 

Experiment – Exploring Amsterdam across digital twins of the HVA, Felix Meritus and het Scheepvaartmuseum in (VR) – Together with The New Base, we developed a digital twin of HVA square. There, and in two other locations across Amsterdam, we hosted an event and experiments in VR bringing together some of our teams to meet “in-avatar.” In the half-day event, we explored ice-breaking, pitch training, lectures, and VR experiments. Highlights included a dance off and Ethics in XR lecture by Anna Valeri Jelezovskaia.
