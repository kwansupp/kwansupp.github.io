## Overview
This AR filter concept is based off of De Bono's Six Thinking Hats, a method for stimulating creative conversations. Each hat represents a role, which represents a specific thinking style, eg. devil's advocate (challenges ideas), optimist (finding the pros in ideas and cheering them on). 

As a concept for hybrid education, we created an AR filter prototype which can be used in video calls, allowing for a more fun and effective online meeting.

Filter provides analytics on how long you have been in a certain role and if a user has been silent for too long, a microphone will pop up, prompting user to speak.
